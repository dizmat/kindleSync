Don’t flash an immediate smile when you greet someone, as though anyone who walked into your line of sight would be the beneficiary. Instead, look at the other person’s face for a second. Pause. Soak in their persona. Then let a big, warm, responsive smile flood over your face and overflow into your eyes. It will engulf the recipient like a warm wave. The split-second delay convinces people your flooding smile is genuine and only for them.

Before walking through any door – the door to your office, a party, a meeting, even your kitchen – picture a leather bit hanging by a cable from the frame. It is swinging just an inch higher than your head. As you pass through the door, throw your head back and chomp on the imaginary dental grip which first pulls your cheeks back into a smile, and then lifts you up. As you ascend high above the gasping crowd, your body is stretched into perfect alignment – head high, shoulders back, torso out of hips, feet weightless. At the zenith of the tent, you spin like a graceful top to the amazement and admiration of the crowd craning their necks to watch you. Now you look like a Somebody.

As we began the journey up to our respective floors, the lift gave several sleepy jerks. ‘Hmm,’ I remarked, in response to the lift’s sluggishness, ‘the lift seems a little flaky.’ Suddenly, each elevator occupant, feeling compelled to exhibit his or her 132-plus IQ, pounced forth with a thunderous explanation. ‘It’s obviously got poor rail-guide alignment,’ announced one. ‘The relay contact is not made up,’ declared another. Suddenly I felt like a grasshopper trapped in a stereo speaker. I couldn’t wait to escape the attack of the mental giants. Afterward, in the solitude of my room, I thought back and reflected that the Mensan’s answers were, indeed, interesting. Why then did I have an adverse reaction? I realized it was too much, too soon. I was tired. Their high energy and intensity jarred my sluggish state. You see, small talk is not about facts or words. It’s about music, about melody. Small talk is about putting people at ease. It’s about making comforting noises together like cats purring, children humming, or groups chanting. You must first match your listener’s mood. Like repeating the note on the music teacher’s harmonica, Top Communicators pick up on their listener’s tone of voice and duplicate it. Instead of jumping in with such intensity, the Mensans could have momentarily matched my lethargic mood by saying, ‘Yes, it is slow, isn’t it?’ Had they then prefaced their information with, ‘Have you ever been curious why an elevator is slow?’ I would have responded with a sincere ‘Yes, I have.’ After a moment of equalized energy levels, I would have welcomed their explanations about the rail-guard alignment or whatever the heck it was. And friendships might have started. I’m sure you’ve suffered the aggression of a mood mismatch. Have you ever been relaxing when some overexcited hot-breathed colleague starts pounding you with questions? Or the reverse: you’re late, rushing to a meeting, when an associate stops you and starts lazily narrating a long, languorous story. No matter how interesting the tale, you don’t want to hear it now. The first step in starting a conversation without strangling it is to match your listener’s mood, if only for a sentence or two. When it comes to small talk, think music, not words. Is your listener adagio or allegro?

Have you educated yourself about the competition? Is there some additional beneϯt your competitor has that you can’t beat, no matter what you do? If so, you’re in the wrong niche. Don’t complain that the game is rigged. Instead, ϯnd a game in which you have a diϦerential advantage.

Most entrepreneurs don’t fail because of a ϲawed business model or an investor who backs out. They fail because they refuse to abandon their preconceived notions about work and life. They refuse to solve (and learn from) any and all kinds of problems as they arise.

What diϦerentiates mediocre people from exceptional ones is how deeply they process. Most people are surface-level processors, but the best of the best go much deeper. Long-term thinking versus short-term thinking is the diϦerence between a grand master and an amateur. Surface-level processors are looking for a quick ϯx. They are thinking only one move ahead, and their goal is to make the issue disappear for now. Deep-level processors look beneath the surface for causes. They are thinking several moves ahead and planning a sequence of moves to make sure the issue doesn’t happen again.

Solving for X means isolating your problem. It’s not enough to say that your problem is your boss. You need to drill down to determine if it’s a lack of autonomy, merit-based pay, or intellectual challenge. You can’t solve for “your boss.” You can solve for a more speciϯc, isolated issue.

1. How to choose your business partners and consigliere 2. How to improve employee retention (create “golden handcuϦs”) 3. How to get your people to perform at peak capacity 4. How to hire and ϯre team members without creating enemies What Benefts Program Do You Ofer? To take the next step from solopreneur or side hustler, you’d better have a good answer to this question: This question is equally relevant if you’re currently a CEO. Before your company gets big, you don’t recruit people to your company; you recruit them to you. Initially, because people are buying you—and you likely don’t have the resources to oϦer an extensive 401(k) plan—you’d better be oϦering an attractive beneϯts program. Later on, you will recruit people to your business. Even then, you must keep improving the beneϯts program, or your top people will leave for a company that has a better one. Ask yourself this question: If people get closer to you, will they win? Will they do better in life? Do you have a résumé—a list of success stories of people whose lives have been enriched from being around you? In other words, think about what beneϯts program you are oϦering prospective employees. If you’re going to attract good people, they need to believe you have something to oϦer them. Instead of being selϯsh and looking to see what I could take from other people, I learned to focus on what I could give them—and I improved my own worth in the process. That paradigm shift—that one decision—changed my life for the better. I stopped asking how other people could make my life better, and instead, I asked: How

great depth in his work, On Providence. He states that it is “not what you endure, but how you endure [which] is important.” It is an interesting book with many fascinating philosophical arguments. He felt that, for a decent man, his “good fortune is not to need good fortune” because when you have achieved the inner harmony espoused by Stoicism, it does not matter what happens to you; you have the strength of spirit to withstand anything life can throw at you. This being the case, it is important to become a ‘good’ man long before anything negative happens so you already have the moral fortitude to be able to cope with it. Not only will you be able to weather the storm, those tough times will strengthen you. To use Seneca’s words to illustrate this point, “No tree becomes rooted and sturdy unless many a wind assails it… the fragile trees are those that have grown in a sunny valley.” Another Stoic philosopher, Musionius Rufus, asked, “Could we acquire courage by realising that things which seem terrible to most people are not to be feared but without practicing being fearless towards them?” After all, things are only labelled positive or negative because of our perception. When we shift our perception, we recognize the positive and negative in all things, and can cope with whatever comes our way. Misfortune is therefore essential to a Stoic way of being. It is an important tool to build our virtue and helps us become better people. In fact, according to Seneca, “God hardens, reviews, and disciplines those whom he approves, whom he loves.” In other words, bad things happen to good people because it helps them become even better. Taking this concept to its logical conclusion, Seneca

Step outside of your comfort zone. We all have things that fill us with dread. Perhaps you don’t have children and the idea of spending time surrounded by toddlers makes you shudder; maybe you don’t like public speaking and do everything you can to avoid giving presentations at work. Whatever makes you feel uncomfortable, you should push yourself to do it. Offer to babysit a friend’s colicky baby. Go to Speaker’s Corner and give a speech about Stoicism. Go to a theme park and ride the biggest rollercoaster. Sing at a karaoke event. Actively participate in whatever activity you can think of that would be your idea of hell. When you face your fears in this way, you discover there are no limits beyond those you place on yourself, and you’re capable of anything you put your mind to. You may even discover you enjoy something you thought you’d hate.

Forget yourself. Have you ever danced like no one’s watching? Let your body move without caring what it looks like? Did you notice that it was much easier to perform a particular movement when you weren’t actively thinking about it? As soon as you start thinking about being mindful, you lose the magic of the moment. You need to forget about what you’re trying to do and just do it. The more you concentrate on why you can’t be mindful and strive to achieve that state, the more impossible it becomes. Instead, forget about your thoughts or fear of failure, and see more of what’s going on around you. See yourself as part of the current moment rather than separate from it. Immerse yourself in your current experience. At random moments during the day, pause and examine what’s going on around you. What can you see? What can you smell? What can you hear? Take it a step further. Close your eyes and notice the little sounds you normally filter out. Maybe it’s the background buzz of traffic. Perhaps you can hear birdsong if you concentrate. Open your eyes and look around you. See your surroundings with new eyes. And then breathe. Inhale deeply three times and savour this unique moment in time, knowing it will never be exactly like this again.

Here are some questions to ask yourself to help you think of the projects that might be on your plate: Notice what’s on your mind: What’s worrying you that you haven’t taken the time to identify as a project? What needs to happen that you’re not making consistent progress on? Look at your calendar: What do you need to follow up on from the past? What needs planning and preparation for the future? Look at your to-do list: What actions are you already taking that are actually part of a bigger project you’ve not yet identified? What communication or follow-up actions you’ve scheduled with people are actually part of a bigger project? Look at your computer desktop, downloads folder, documents folder, bookmarks, emails, or open browser tabs: What are you keeping around because it is part of a larger project?

There are five kinds of Intermediate Packets you can create and reuse in your work: Distilled notes: Books or articles you’ve read and distilled so it’s easy to get the gist of what they contain (using the Progressive Summarization technique you learned in the previous chapter, for example). Outtakes: The material or ideas that didn’t make it into a past project but could be used in future ones. Work-in-process: The documents, graphics, agendas, or plans you produced during past projects. Final deliverables: Concrete pieces of work you’ve delivered as part of past projects, which could become components of something new. Documents created by others: Knowledge assets created by people on your team, contractors or consultants, or even clients or customers, that you can reference and incorporate into your work.

open Internet, which is full of distracting ads, misleading headlines, superficial content, and pointless controversy, all of which can throw me off track. I run a series of searches for terms related to the new project, scanning the results and quickly jumping into any note that seems relevant. Progressive Summarization helps here too, enabling me to zoom into and out of notes without having to absorb their full contents. 4. Move (or tag) relevant notes to the project folder. Fourth, any notes found in the previous two steps I move to the project folder, titled after the name of the new project I’m starting. Alternatively, depending on the capabilities of your notes app, you can also tag or link any relevant notes with the project, so you don’t have to move them from their original location. The important thing isn’t where a note is located, but whether you can reference it quickly while staying focused on the project at hand. 5. Create an outline of collected notes and plan the project. Finally, it’s time to pull together the material I’ve gathered and create an outline (an Archipelago of Ideas) for the project. My goal is to end up not just with a loose collection of ideas. It is to formulate a logical progression of steps that make it clear what I should do next. The form this outline takes depends on the nature of the project. If it is a piece of writing such as an essay or report, the outline might be the main points or headings I want to include in the final piece. If it is a document outlining a collaborative project with colleagues or outside contractors, the outline might include the objectives we’re working toward and tentative responsibilities for each person. If it is a trip I’m planning to take, it might be a packing list and itinerary. The

Here are some other options for actions you might want to include in your own version: Answer premortem* questions: What do you want to learn? What is the greatest source of uncertainty or most important question you want to answer? What is most likely to fail? Communicate with stakeholders: Explain to your manager, colleagues, clients, customers, shareholders, contractors, etc., what the project is about and why it matters. Define success criteria: What needs to happen for this project to be considered successful? What are the minimum results you need to achieve, or the “stretch goals” you’re striving for? Have an official kickoff: Schedule check-in calls, make a budget and timeline, and write out the goals and objectives to make sure everyone is informed, aligned, and clear on what is expected of them. I find that doing an official kickoff is useful even if it’s a solo project!

Communicate with stakeholders: Notify your manager, colleagues, clients, customers, shareholders, contractors, etc., that the project is complete and what the outcomes were. Evaluate success criteria: Were the objectives of the project achieved? Why or why not? What was the return on investment?

I’ve spoken with so many people about their stories, and I’ve noticed time and again how many of them have beautiful, moving, powerful things to share. They have unique experiences that have revealed to them deep wisdom, yet they almost always undervalue those stories and experiences. They think maybe one day they’ll get around to sharing them. I’m here to tell you that there is no reason to wait. The world is desperate to hear what you know. You can change lives by sharing yourself with others. It takes courage and vulnerability to stand up and deliver your message. It takes going against the grain, refusing to be quiet and hidden in the face of fear. Finding your voice and speaking your truth is a radical act of self-worth: Who are you to speak up? Who says you have anything to offer? Who are you to demand people’s attention and take up their time? The only way to discover the answer to these questions is by speaking and seeing what comes out. Some of what you say might not resonate with others or provide value to them, but occasionally, you will strike on something—a way of seeing, a perspective, a story—that blows people’s minds and visibly transforms how they see the world. It could be someone you’re having coffee with, a client or customer, or your online followers. In those moments, the vast chasm that separates us as humans is bridged. For a brief moment, you get to feel in your bones that we are all in this together. We are all part of a vast tattered fabric of humanity, and your highest calling is simply to play your part in it.

Our first instinct is to always trust appearances. We cannot go around doubting the reality of what we see and hear—constantly imagining that appearances concealed something else would exhaust and terrify us. This fact makes it relatively easy to conceal one’s intentions. Simply dangle an object you seem to desire, a goal you seem to aim for, in front of people’s eyes and they will take the appearance for reality. Once their eyes focus on the decoy, they will fail to notice what you are really up to

Use this tactic in the following manner: Hide your intentions not by closing up (with the risk of appearing secretive, and making people suspicious) but by talking endlessly about your desires and goals—just not your real ones. You will kill three birds with one stone: You appear friendly, open, and trusting; you conceal your intentions; and you send your rivals on time-consuming wild-goose chases

One oft-told tale about Kissinger… involved a report that Winston Lord had worked on for days. After giving it to Kissinger, he got it back with the notation, “Is this the best you can do?” Lord rewrote and polished and finally resubmitted it; back it came with the same curt question. After redrafting it one more time—and once again getting the same question from Kissinger-Lord snapped, “Damn it, yes, it’s the best I can do. ” To which Kissinger replied: “Fine, then I guess I’ll read it this time. ”

During China’s War of the Three Kingdoms (A.D. 207-265), the great general Chuko Liang, leading the forces of the Shu Kingdom, dispatched his vast army to a distant camp while he rested in a small town with a handful of soldiers. Suddenly sentinels hurried in with the alarming news that an enemy force of over 150,000 troops under Sima Yi was approaching. With only a hundred men to defend him, Chuko Liang’s situation was hopeless. The enemy would finally capture this renowned leader. Without lamenting his fate, or wasting time trying to figure out how he had been caught, Liang ordered his troops to take down their flags, throw open the city gates, and hide. He himself then took a seat on the most visible part of the city’s wall, wearing a Taoist robe. He lit some incense, strummed his lute, and began to chant. Minutes later he could see the vast enemy army approaching, an endless phalanx of soldiers. Pretending not to notice them, he continued to sing and play the lute. Soon the army stood at the town gates. At its head was Sima Yi, who instantly recognized the man on the wall. Even so, as his soldiers itched to enter the unguarded town through its open gates, Sima Yi hesitated, held them back, and studied Liang on the wall. Then, he ordered an immediate and speedy retreat

Each morning, as you decide to put on your shoes in a certain manner, let this simple act serve as a reminder to change other habitual ways of thinking, acting, and feeling throughout that one day. Say to yourself as you tie your shoes, “I am beginning the day in a new and better way.” Then, consciously decide that throughout the day: 1. I will be as cheerful as possible. 2. I will try to feel and act a little more friendly toward other people. 3. I am going to be a little less critical and a little more tolerant of other people, their faults, failings, and mistakes. I will place the best possible interpretation on their actions. 4. Insofar as possible, I am going to act as if successes are inevitable, and I already am the sort of personality I want to be. I will practice “acting like” and “feeling like” this new personality. 5. I will not let my own opinion color facts in a pessimistic or negative way. 6. I will practice smiling at least three times during the day. 7. Regardless of what happens, I will react as calmly and as intelligently as possible. 8. I will ignore completely and close my mind to all those pessimistic and negative “facts” that I can do nothing to change.

It is a way of proving to yourself and others your superiority. But it is self-defeating. If you are perfect and superior now—then there is no need to fight, grapple, and try. In fact, if you are caught trying real hard, it may be considered evidence that you are not superior—so you don’t try. You lose your fight—your will to win.

Thinking of these "steps". I think it makes sense to say every step is upwards. Why?
In his pursuit h would take a concept and tweak it's real life rendition and take  "side step" with some iteration or take a backwards step to go back to a previous concept that worked better. Even with all thesesteps, he is going upwards to an unknown final destination. He could be going down aswell lol but the ide is that with each mistake he is moving in the xy AND z plane.

One of the most beneficial prescriptions that I have ever given patients is the advice to learn to return into this quiet, tranquil center. And one of the best ways that I have found for entering this quiet center is to build for yourself, in imagination, a little mental room. Furnish this room with whatever is most restful and refreshing to you: perhaps beautiful landscapes, if you like paintings; a volume of your favorite verse, if you like poetry. The colors of the walls are your own favorite “pleasant” colors, but should be chosen from the restful hues of blue, light green, yellow, gold. The room is plainly and simply furnished; there are no distracting elements. It is very neat and everything is in order. Simplicity, quietness, beauty are the keynotes. It contains your favorite easy chair. From one small window you can look out and see a beautiful beach. The waves roll in upon the beach and retreat, but you cannot hear them, for your room is very, very quiet. Take as much care in building this room in your imagination as you would in building an actual room. Be thoroughly familiar with every detail.

Create in your imagination a vivid mental picture of yourself sitting quietly, composed, unmoved, letting your telephone ring, as outlined earlier in this chapter. Then, in your daily activities “carry-over” the same peaceful, composed, unmoved attitude by remembering this mental picture. Say to yourself, “I am letting the telephone ring,” whenever you are tempted to “obey” or respond to some fear-bell or anxiety-bell. Next, use your imagination to practice non-response in various sorts of situations: See yourself sitting quietly and unmoved while an associate rants and raves. See yourself going through your daily tasks one by one, calmly, composed, unhurried, in spite of the pressures of a busy day. See yourself maintaining the same constant, stable course, in spite of the various hurry-bells and pressure-bells in your environment. See yourself in various situations that have in the past upset you, only now you remain “set,” settled, poised—by not responding.

It had required six strong men to place the piano in the house. One rather frail man, under the stimulus of excitement and crisis, took it out by himself.

‘As thy days so shall thy strength be.’” The secret lies in the attitude of fearlessly accepting the challenge, and confidently expending our strength. This means maintaining an aggressive, goal-directed attitude, rather than a defensive, evasive, negative one: No matter what happens, I can handle it, or I can see it through, rather than I hope nothing happens.

The essence of this aggressive attitude is remaining goal-oriented. You keep your own positive goal in mind. You intend to “go through” the crisis experience to achieve your goal. You keep your original positive goal, and do not get sidetracked into secondary ones—the desire to run away, to hide, to avoid the crisis situation.
